#CodeInColor.vim
##**NB** this script currently does nothing noticeable

A vim plugin inspired by an [interesting article](https://medium.com/p/3a6db2743a1e/) about a new style of coloring your code.

##In a nutshell
Coloring the keywords of a language, mostly help us identify the language itself. Coloring our variable names on the other hand would(probably?) help us follow the flow of the logic itself.

##What it does

So far only supports python3 and requires [py3names](https://github.com/kunev/py3names) in order to work.
